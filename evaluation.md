# ✅ Evaluation
---

- Phase 1: **Development phase**

We provide you with labeled training data and unlabeled test data. Train your model on the training data and submit your model's predictions on codabench (The end of the "readme.ipynb" file of the starting kit gives you an example to create a submission). Your performance will be displayed on the leaderboard.

- Phase 2: **Final phase**


Your best prediction of the development phase will be forwarded. Your best submitted performance on the test set will be displayed on the final leaderboard.

# ✅Metric
----
The metric used to score the submissions is the geometric mean accuracy. For each image-style class, an accuracy score is computed. The final output correspond to the geometric mean of those accuracies.
