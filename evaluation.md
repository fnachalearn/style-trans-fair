# ✅  Phases

This challenge conists of two phases:

1. **Development Phase**

We provide you with labeled training data and unlabeled test data. Train your model on the training data and submit your model's predictions on codabench (The end of the "readme.ipynb" file of the starting kit gives you an example to create a submission). Your performance will be displayed on the leaderboard.Once you are satisfied with your performance then you can try the Final Phase
2. **Final Phase**
