# âœ… Competition overview
---
Over the past few years, society has been grappling with the extent to which human biases can be incorporated into artificial intelligence systems, leading to harmful consequences. With the proliferation of big data, optimizing AI systems solely for performance will not only fail to improve real-world applications, but also increase the risk of bias in ways that may not be immediately apparent.

Many datasets are plagued by bias. For instance, background is a big source of bias in image datasets (e.g planes usually have sky backgrounds, boats usually have water backgrounds, etc) which causes machine learning models to learn its noise (e.g classify all sky backgrounds as planes, or all water backgrounds as boats, etc).
To mimic this effect, we introduce a creative way to add controlled bias into the dataset, which is called Neural Style Transfer. This method can be generalized to all kinds of domains and also requires little to no manual work when creating synthetic images.

## Main goal of this competition

The goal of this challenge is to perform multi-task classification with a training dataset biased towards Styles. You will need to make sure it performs well on an unbiased test dataset. More info can be found in Data tab.


# âœ… Competition Phases
---
This challenge consists of two phases : 
> - **Development Phase** : In this phase, Participants can train a model and submit at most **5 submissions per day** to check the score of your model and to see how good your model is performing.  Once you are satisfied with your performance then you can try the Final Phase. 

> - **Final Phase** : In this phase you can submit only once so it is advised to do it when you are ready for the final submission.

# âœ… Who can take part?
---
Anyone interested in machine learning and who would like to improve their skills can participate in this competition. So don't miss this opportunity and do your best.

**Note** : No prizes, this is an educational challenge.
