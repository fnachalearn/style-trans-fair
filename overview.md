# âœ… Competition overview
---
Many datasets are plagued by bias, but not just fairness related bias. For instance, image datasets, background is a source of bias (example: airplanes in the skyâ€¦). Classifiers may be induced to rely on background. So, we designed a dataset with bias. Indeed, the idea was to induce a bias by using the ***style transfer***, to create fake paintings whose style is in correlation with the subject to be recognized.

***STYLE-TRANS-FAIR*** challenge aims at detecting bias in image data, making sure deep-learning methods do not base classification decisions on the style of an image rather than recognizing the objects or animals. 

- **Main goal of this competition** : The main goal is about creating a Machine Learning model and train it with the data provided to classify the images into 3 Classes without being biased towards Styles. 

This challenge uses a Dataset from **Meta Album**. There are *5 tasks in the Development phase* and *5 tasks in the Final Phase*. Each task in the dataset consists of **360** images splited into **9 groups**. we also have 2 set : the training and test set, where **the training set is biased in Style, and the test set is balanced**. (You can see the data section to know more about the data and the distribution of the task please).



# âœ… Competition Phases
---
This challenge consists of two phases : 
> - **Development Phase** : In this phase, Participants can train a model and submit at most **5 submissions per day** to check the score of your model and to see how good your model is performing.  Once you are satisfied with your performance then you can try the Final Phase. 

> - **Final Phase** : In this phase you can submit only once so it is advised to do it when you are ready for the final submission.

# âœ… Who can take part ?
