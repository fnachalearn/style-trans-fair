    <h1> âœ… Competition overview</h1>
    <hr class="solid">
    Many datasets are plagued by bias, but not just fairness related bias. For instance, image datasets, background is a source of bias (example: airplanes in the skyâ€¦). Classifiers may be induced to rely on background. So, we designed a dataset with bias. Indeed, the idea was to induce a bias by using the <b>style transfer</b>, to create fake paintings whose style is in correlation with the subject to be recognized.

    <b>STYLE-TRANS-FAIR</b> challenge aims at detecting bias in image data, making sure deep-learning methods do not base classification decisions on the style of an image rather than recognizing the objects or animals. 

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Main goal of this competition</b> : The main goal is about creating a Machine Learning model and train it with the data provided to classify the images into 3 Classes without being biased towards Styles. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    This challenge uses a Dataset from <b>Meta Album</b>. There are <b>5 tasks in the Development phase</b> and <b>5 tasks in the Final Phase</b>. Each task in the dataset consists of <b>360</b> images splited into <b>9 groups</b>. we also have 2 set : the training and test set, where <b>the training set is biased in Style, and the test set is balanced</b>. (You can see the data section to know more about the data and the distribution of the task please).



    <h1> âœ… Competition Phases</h1>
    <hr class="solid">
    This challenge consists of two phases : 
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Development Phase</b> : In this phase, Participants can train a model and submit at most <b>5 submissions per day</b> to check the score of your model and to see how good your model is performing.  Once you are satisfied with your performance then you can try the Final Phase. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Final Phase</b> : In this phase you can submit only once so it is advised to do it when you are ready for the final submission.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1> âœ… Who can take part ?</h1>
    <hr class="solid">
