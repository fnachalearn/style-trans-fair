    <h1> ✅ Overview</h1>
    <hr class="solid">
    This challenge uses a dataset from <a href="https://meta-album.github.io/">Meta Album</a>. All images of this dataset are resized into <b>512x512 pixels</b>. The following image is an example of a stylized image of an insect.

    <h1> ✅ Data description</h1>
    <hr class="solid">

    This challenge is composed of the two following phases:
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The <b>development phase</b>:
            <ul>
                <li>5 tasks</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The <b>final phase</b>:
            <ul>
                <li>5 other tasks</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    

    Each task is composed of:
    <ul>
        <li>
            A labels.csv file composed of the following columns:
            <ul>
                <li>"ORIG_CATEGORY_FILE" is the <b>file used</b> for the construction of the <b>category</b> of the image</li>
                <li>"CATEGORY" is the <b>name of the insect category</b> of the image</li>
                <li>"ORIG_STYLE_FILE" is the <b>file used</b> for the construction of the <b>style of the image</b></li>
                <li>"STYLE" is the name of the <b>style used</b> to build the image</li>
                <li>"FILE_NAME" is the <b>name of the image</b></li>
                <li>"label_cat" is the <b>label</b> of the image (the category)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            A "content" folder containing the <b>insect images</b> used to build the final images
        </li>
        <li>
            A "styles" folder containing the <b>style images</b> used to build the final images
        </li>
        <li>
            A "stylized" folder containing the <b>final stylized images</b> obtained with the "style-transfert" technique from an insect image and a style image. It is those images we want to predict the class.
        </li>
    </ul>

    Each task in this dataset consits of <b>360 labeled images</b> of insects splitted into <b>9 groups</b> distributed with <b>3 styles and 3 classes</b>.

    The 9 groups of images are imbalanced, resulting in bias in the dataset: each class is more represented in one of the 3 styles in order to fool machine learning models which will correlate classes to their corresponding style.
